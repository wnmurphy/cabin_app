        <p>This is the Notes List.</p>
        <p>General notes about the cabin.</p>
        
        <h2>Plowing the driveway</h2>
        <p>If it's been a snowy winter, you may need to have the driveway plowed before you come up.</p>

        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>The neighborhood is wired for internet; the access point is <code>xfinitywifi</code>.</p>
        <p>If you have a Comcast account, then you can use your account login.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, it costs something like $8 for 24 hours of access.</p>
        <p>The signal is decent out on the porch, but you can pick some up at the dinner table.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> use a browser like Brave and turn off JavaScript to make the connection much faster. This will break some web pages, but really helps when the signal is weak. You can also speed up the connection without disabling JavaScript by using browser extensions that block expensive requests to ad trackers. Disconnect, Adblock Plus, and Ghostery are good.</p>
        <p>You can string up the hammock in the backyard and get a signal strong enough to stream Netflix or work remotely, if you go towards the back of the property towards either far corner.</p>
        
        <h2>Hammock</h2>
        <p>There is a lightweight hammock by the ladder in the loft. It seats two, and you can take it up to Lake Alpine or Spicer Reservoir if you want to go have a nice picnic and a nap some place.</p>
        <p>There are two black hammock straps (not in the pouch) which each go around a tree, and have multiple loops to hook the hammock hooks into.</p>
        <p>You feed the strap through itself using the big loop on the end.</p>
        <p>Pick trees that are ~7 ft. apart, and keep in mind that the hammock height will settle (sag) a bit once you get in.</p>
        <p>To avoid damaging the tree (especially if you string the hammock up at the cabin), find some twigs and wedge them between the strap and the tree. This prevents damage to the bark.</p>

        <h2>Heating</h2>
        <p>In the winter, you can heat the cabin using the two electric space heaters. They're not nearly as effective as the giant gas heater, but that one is out of commission until the small deck is rebuilt so the gas company will run a new line (the gas line currently runs under the small deck, which they said was too sketchy).</p>
        <p>In other words, if you come up in the winter, you'll also be wearing a few layers indoors even when the heaters are both going.</p>
        <p>If you're desperate, you can run the oven with the door open, but this is inadvisable because it's a waste of energy and wears out the filiments.</p>
