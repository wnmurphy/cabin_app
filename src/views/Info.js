        <h1>Information</h1>
        <p>General information about the cabin.</p>
        
        <h2>Groceries</h2>
        <p>It's most convenient to buy food on the way up. There are two grocery stores in Angel's Camp, and there's a grocery store in Arnold as well.</p>

        <h2>Sleeping Arrangements</h2>
        <p>The cabin has a bedroom with a queen sized bed, and a queen-sized futon. Both can sleep two. The futon mattress is firmer, and it's in the main room.</p>
        <p>You should bring your preferred sheets and a blanket/sleeping bag. There are some sheets up here, but they're hand-me-downs and don't really get used or laundered.</p>

        <h2>Laundry</h2>
        <p>Nope. You'll probably want to bring your own towel too. There are towels up here, but like the sheets they aren't often used or laundered.</p>

        <h2>Plumbing</h2>
        <p>Plese don't let any food go down the kitchen drain. Before you leave, empty out the metal trap into the garbage or toss it outside.</p>

        <h2>Plowing the Driveway</h2>
        <p>If it's been a snowy winter, you may need to call ahead and have the driveway plowed before you come up.</p>
        <p>Be advised that it has happened in the past that Murietta's Roost was not plowed during snow season. If this happens, you'll have to hike in about 80 yards to the end of the street.</p>

        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>The neighborhood is wired for internet; the access point is <code>xfinitywifi</code>.</p>
        <p>If you have a Comcast account, then you can use your account login.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, it costs something like $8 for 24 hours of access.</p>
        <p>The signal is decent out on the porch, but you can pick some up at the dinner table.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> use a browser like Brave (blocks unnecessary data) and turn off JavaScript to make the connection much faster. This will break some web pages, but really helps when the signal is weak. You can also speed up the connection without disabling JavaScript by using browser extensions that block expensive requests to ad trackers. Disconnect, Adblock Plus, and Ghostery are good.</p>
        <p>You can string up the hammock in the backyard and get a signal strong enough to stream Netflix or work remotely, if you go towards the back of the property towards either far corner.</p>
        
        <h2>Hammock</h2>
        <p>There is a lightweight hammock by the ladder in the loft. It fits two people, and you can take it up to Lake Alpine or Spicer Reservoir if you want to go have a nice picnic and a nap some place.</p>
        <p>There are two black hammock straps (not in the pouch) which each go around a tree, and have multiple loops to hook the hammock hooks into.</p>
        <p>You feed the strap through itself using the big loop on the end.</p>
        <p>Pick trees that are ~7 ft. apart, and keep in mind that the hammock height will settle (sag) a bit once you get in.</p>
        <p>To avoid damaging the tree (especially if you string the hammock up at the cabin), find some twigs and wedge them between the strap and the tree. This prevents damage to the bark.</p>

        <h2>Heating</h2>
        <p>In the winter, you can heat the cabin using the two electric space heaters. They're not nearly as effective as the giant gas heater, but that one is out of commission until the small deck is rebuilt so the gas company will run a new line (the gas line currently runs under the small deck, which they said was too sketchy).</p>
        <p>If you run both heaters on full on the same circuit, the circuit will trip. If this happens, try moving one to a different outlet. </p>
        <p>In other words, if you come up in the winter, you'll probably want to be wearing a few layers indoors even when the heaters are both going.</p>
        <p>If you're desperate, you can run the oven with the door open, but this is inadvisable because it's a waste of energy and wears out the filiments.</p>

        <h2>PS3</h2>
        <p>Pete was kind enough to donate his PS3 and Samsung TV.</p>
        <p>There are some games, and you can play DVDs on it too.</p>
