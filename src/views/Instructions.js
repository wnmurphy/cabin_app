        <h1>Opening and Closing Procedures</h1>
        
        <h2>To Open Up:</h2>

        <h3>1. Unlock the cabin.</h3>
        <p>Open the cabin from the small deck. (I think this is because no one has a key to the outer snow door on the large deck side.)</p>
        <p>If you need to dig a path through snow, there's a snow shovel under the small deck.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Turn on the power.</h3>
        <p>Flip the main breaker switch to turn on power to the cabin.</p>
        <p>The switch is the single switch at the top of the circuit breaker panel, which is on the wall in the kitchen to the left of the stove.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a cell phone handy for a flashlight, there should be an LED flashlight in the first kitchen drawer.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Plug in the fridge and close the door.</h3>
        <p>The fridge is left open when no one's here so any residual moisture doesn't get trapped.</p>

        <h3>4. Turn on the water.</h3>
        <p>The water controls are in the green plastic box on the ground on the left side of the cabin as you face it from the driveway.</p>
        <p>There are two handles. One turns on the water supply to the cabin. The other closes the main drain from the cabin so the water coming in doesn't just drain out to the driveway.</p>
        <p>Flip both handles.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Close the cold water faucets.</h3>
        <p>When you shut the cabin drain and turn on the water supply, you should be able to hear the water running out of all the faucets inside. These are left open to drain when you go home.</p>
        <p>Go inside and close the cold water faucets. Leave the hot water faucets open to bleed air from the water heater.</p>

        <h3>6. Close both drain faucets on the water heater</h3>
        <p>There are two drain faucets on the water heater in the kitchen: on is at the floor (with the hose going through the floor). The other is to the right of the heater against the wall. Close 'em both.</p>

        <h3>7. Close the hot water faucets.</h3>
        <p>A few minutes after you close the water heater drain faucets, you should get water coming from the hot water faucets in the kitchen and bathroom. Close them off.</p>

        <h3>8. Turn on the water heater</h3>
        <p>Now that all the air in the water heater has been bled through the hot water faucets, go ahead and turn the water heater on by flipping the switch to the left of the circuit breaker panel in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>You should have hot water in about 20-30 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Never turn the water heater on (or leave it running) unless the tank is full.</strong> The heating element will burn out if run dry. You'll know the tank is full when the hot water lines run steady water instead of sputtering air.</p>
        
        <h2>To Close Up:</h2>

        <p>Closing the cabin is basically the same process as opening, but in reverse.</p>

        <h3>1. Clean up.</h3>
        <p>Wash the dishes. Empty the food bits from the drain trap. Sweep/mop the floor, and clean surfaces like the kitchen counter, dining table, and stove.</p>

        <h3>2. Turn off the water heater.</h3>

        <h3>3. Go outside and flip the drain/water supply faucet handles in the green box.</h3>

        <h3>4. Go inside and open all of the hot and cold faucets.</h3>

        <h3>5. Open the water heater drains.</h3>
        <p>The one on the floor drains to the driveway hose, and the one at the wall drains underneath the cabin.</p>

        <h3>6. Pour half a cup of antifreeze in each of the drains.</h3>
        <p>Water left in the U-traps of the pipes can expand and crack the pipes if temperatures get below freezing.</p>
        <p>The antifreeze should be on the floor by the wall in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Pour some in: kitchen sink drain, shower drain, bathroom sink drain, toilet bowl, toilet reservoir.</p>
        <p>Take care not to splash it on surrounding surfaces.</p>

        <h3>7. Turn the power off.</h3>
        
        <h3>8. Unplug the fridge and prop the door open with a broom.</h3>

        <h3>9. Pack out your garbage.</h3>
        <p>You can haul it home, or you can find a nearby garbage can to discretely toss it in. I usually toss my bag at the Arnold grocery store shopping center. On the eastmost end, there's a can that's usually empty.</p>

        <h3>8. Close curtains and lock up.</h3>
        <p>Please make sure all doors are latched securely.</p>
