        <h1>Opening and Closing Procedures</h1>
        <p>The main concerns are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave no water in the pipes when you go home. The pipes will crack if the water freezes.</li>
          <li>Never turn the water heater on (or leave it running) unless the tank is full. The heating element will burn out if run dry.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Opening Up</h2>

        <h3>Unlocking the cabin.</h3>
        <p>Open the cabin from the small deck. (I think this is because no one has a key to the outer snow door on the large deck side.)</p>
        <p>If you need to dig a path through snow, there's a snow shovel under the small deck.</p>
        
        <h3>Turning on the power.</h3>
        <p>The first thing to do, especially if you arrive at night, is to flip the main breaker switch (located in the kitchen to the left of the stove) to turn on power to the cabin.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a cell phone handy for a flashlight, there should be an LED flashlight in the first kitchen drawer.</p>

        <h3>Turning on the water.</h3>
        
        <p></p>

        <h2>Closing Up</h2>

        <p>Closing the cabin is essentially the same process of opening, but in reverse.</p>
